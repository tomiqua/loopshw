//         <!-- Create a web page that prompts the user for two numbers: 
//         a beginning number and an ending number.  

// Your function should count up how many odd numbers there are, 
// and how many even numbers there are, between the two arguments, and
// display the result on the web page (use document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = your_value_here ;)

// EXTRA CREDIT: Check if the second number is larger than the first.  If it's not, ask the user to make sure the second number is the larger of the two. -->
